# DiscordCSS
A collection of my Discord CSS styles

## Using these themes
All (or at least most) of these themes are written in SCSS instead of CSS, so you will have to compile them first. To
compile SCSS code into CSS, either use the commandline tool you can find [on the official site](http://sass-lang.com/dart-sass),
or use a graphical interface such as [Scout.app](http://scout-app.io/).

As for loading the CSS themes into Discord, I recommend using [BeautifulDiscord by leovoel](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord).
It's a great tool that allows hot-reloading custom CSS in Discord, and doesn't have the security risks that come with
BetterDiscord (which I advice you not to use). Instructions to install it can be found in its repository.

**NOTE**: These styles are meant to work with the **Dark** Discord theme. If you use the White theme, please switch to
Dark if you don't like looking at a broken mess.

## Themes

### Custom Configurations
Because these themes are meant to be very configurable, it's easy to create your own configuration with the settings 
you prefer. Below, you can find an example of a configuration that I use (at the time of writing) where various extra
options are enabled.

Path: `personal.scss`
